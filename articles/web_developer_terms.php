	<li>Request - A request is what is sent to a web server when we interact with a site on our browsers. Requests tell the web server what information it is that we'd like to receive back. For example, to navigate to a new page on a site we must send a request for that page. When the server receives a request it will send back the response. The two most-common requests are "GET", used to retrieve information from a server,  and "POST" which passes some type of data to the server.</li>
