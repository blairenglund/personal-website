<h1>Origami inspires new technology</h1>

<h3>Scientists are using the ancient art of folding to create new technology on the nano- and macro-scale.</h3>

<p>
	Origami has existed since the first monks brought paper from China to Japan in the 6th century CE. For most of that existence the rarity of paper meant that origami was only used for special ceremonial purposes. That changed in the 17th century with major advancements in the mass-production of paper.
