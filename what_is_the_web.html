		<h3>what is the web?</h3>

		<h4>What started as a project to help physicists share their research has now evolved into a tool so ubiquitous that it's hard -- impossible for some -- to imagine daily life without it.</h4>

			The World Wide Web is a mainstay of life in the age of technology. It contains every website we visit from Amazon to Zillow and it's only going to continue expanding. It allows us to shop from our homes, read up on just about anything we're interested in, and distract ourselves in countless ways, but what is it? Where did it come from? And how does it actually work?<br><br>

			The World Wide Web is a tool that exists on the Internet. It is not the same thing as the Internet, but it exists as a service on the Internet, like email and FTP. It contains an ever-growing number of text documents as well as the tools that allow us to find and display those documents in our own web browsers.<br><br>

			It was created by British scientist Tim Berners-Lee as a way for CERN physicists to share their research with other scientists across the world. Prior to the creation of the Web, computers connected to the Internet shared information via a number of different protocalls. There was not a simple way of accessing a page with information.
