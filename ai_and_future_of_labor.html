		<h3>intelligent machines threaten major upheavals in employment and labor.</h3>

		<h4>As automation and artificial intelligence replace jobs traditionally done by humans, millions will become unemployed, and without a plan in place, we could face a 'labor displacement of a magnitude we haven't seen since the 1930s.'</h4>

		<p>If a trucking company had a choice between a team of human drivers and a fleet of self-driven trucks, what's the likeliest choice? Whereas human drivers need food, sleep, and money (and are prone to error when those needs aren't met), an intelligent, self-driving vehicle can drive 24/7 with only occasional stops for fuel and maintenance and never get in an accident. "What company, faced with that choice, would choose expensive, error-prone human drivers?" says Andrew Ng, chief scientist at Baidu.<br><br>
		Those truck drivers, like millions of others working in careers with the potential for full automation, may find themselves wholly unemployed in the near future. Fortunately, this potential upheaval is not unprecedented.<br><br>
		Prior to the Industrial Revolution, 90% of Americans worked on farms. Over the course of nearly two centuries, many of those farm jobs disappeared and were replaced by jobs in industry. That amount of time allowed for the gradual urbanization of the U.S. Today's laborers won't have the luxury of time, though.<br><br>
		Self-driving vehicles have already hit the road and it may not be long until most or all travel and shipping is automated. This could lead to unemployment rates that would rival those of the Great Depression. The key to overcoming such a crisis? Providing relief and retraining for the economically displaced. In 1933, Roosevelt's New Deal helped rebuild the economy and the United States' infrastructure by putting the unemployed to work in programs like the Public Works Administration.<br><br>
		"We need to update the New Deal for the 21st century and establish a trainee program for the new jobs artificial intelligence will create."" says Ng. While old jobs will disappear, countless new jobs we can't imagine will be created. A proactive approach to training people for those jobs is necessary to make the transition to an era of machine-intelligence a smooth one.</p>
